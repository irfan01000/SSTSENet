# MSTSENet:  multiscale Transformer with SENet for HSIC

This repository contains the official code implementation for the paper titled "Spectral Transformer with SENet for HSIC".

**Please note that the code will be uploaded soon after the paper's publication.**

## Overview

This repository will host the code for the proposed SSTSENet model, which combines various deep-learning components for improved hyperspectral image classification. 

## Paper Abstract

[Will be updated soon.]

## Code Structure

The code will be organized into logical folders for different components of the model and experiments. Here's a brief overview of the expected structure:

- `data_preprocessing/`: Scripts for preprocessing hyperspectral datasets.
- `model_architecture/`: Implementation of the SSTSENet model and its components.
- `experiments/`: Scripts for running experiments and evaluating the model.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `pretrained_models/`: Pretrained models (if applicable).

## Installation

To be updated once the code is uploaded.

## Usage

To be updated once the code is uploaded.
